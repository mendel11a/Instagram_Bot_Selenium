# Instagram_Bot_Selenium

### I built an instagram bot that helps you build a new account by only putting registration informations:
#### Email
#### Full name
#### Username
#### Password
### The user has also to put his email and email password so that the bot can bring from the email the number confirmation that will be send by instagram.
### Finally, the user enters the name of the instagram user he wants to follow and the bot make this for him.

## Directories :
#### pip install Selenium
#### download chromedriver
