# Instagram_Bot_Selenium

## I built an instagram bot that helps you build a new instagram account and follow after an instagram user.
### First the user has to give to the bot these informations so that he could register him to instagram:
#### Email
#### Full name
#### Username
#### Password
### After that,the user has also to put his email and email password so that the bot can bring from the email the number confirmation that will be send by instagram.
### Finally, the user enters the name of the instagram user he wants to follow and the bot makes this for him.

## Directories :
#### pip install Selenium
#### download chromedriver
